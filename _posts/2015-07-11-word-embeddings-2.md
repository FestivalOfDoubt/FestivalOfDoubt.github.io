# Basics

Posts are written in markdown. The variant of markdown we use is called 'kramdown'. Here is a [quick reference](http://kramdown.gettalong.org/quickref.html). What you just saw was the syntax for a hyperlink in markdown.

You can include an image like this:

Below is a subsection.

## Lists

This is a list:

* One
* Two
* Three
* and so on

This is an enumerated list:

1. one
2. two
3. three
4. four

# Using math

## Inline formulas

Indicate a latex formala with double dollar signs. You do this even for inline math. Like so.
Let $$f\colon\mathbb{R}^n\to\mathbb{R}$$.

## Display formulas

To use a display formula instead of inline math, simple offset it to a new line.

$$
f(0) = 0
$$

That's all.
